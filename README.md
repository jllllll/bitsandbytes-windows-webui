# bitsandbytes-windows-webui
Windows compile of bitsandbytes for use in text-generation-webui.  
Compiled for CUDA 11.1-11.8.  
0.38.1+ additionally includes support for 12.0 and 12.1.

**0.39.0 currently doesn't support cards with compute less than 7.0 on Windows.**  
**To my understanding, this is a limitation of the Windows Cuda Toolkit.**

Can be installed with the following command:

0.37.2:
```
python -m pip install https://github.com/jllllll/bitsandbytes-windows-webui/raw/main/bitsandbytes-0.37.2-py3-none-any.whl --force-reinstall
```
0.38.1:
```
python -m pip install https://github.com/jllllll/bitsandbytes-windows-webui/raw/main/bitsandbytes-0.38.1-py3-none-any.whl --force-reinstall
```
0.39.0:
```
python -m pip install https://github.com/jllllll/bitsandbytes-windows-webui/raw/main/bitsandbytes-0.39.0-py3-none-any.whl
```
